I got into school theatre early and later took on leadership roles, from English Drama Society secretary to Gavel Club president. My entrepreneurial started surfacing when I was 16. My passion for arts made me want to start an Artist Management company. At 18 I launched PlantedIce, an independent label to back youth artists who wanted to make unconventional work. At the time, we managed three artists, produced 6 projects, including the Bradby-anthem for the Prestigious Royal College, Colombo. We also did projects that touched the topics of Men's Mental Health and Social Issues related to politics."

My father works in cybersecurity at Sri Lanka Telecom, and he's heavily involved in the field of IT and his colleagues were heavily involved in Automation. Hence, I tinkered early with ChatGPT, n8n, and Power Apps. Formal exposure (including AI for Everyone by deeplearning.ai) and my time at N-able deepened that interest and pushed me to thread automation into real workflows."
